      header: Optimizing Cost
      content_html: |
        <p>
          Because real estate is the second largest recurring cost after
          salaries, optimizing it to support your business
          strategy should be a key source of economies.
        </p>
        <p>Some key tools Monarch Eurasia uses include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Optimize your use of floor space</li>
          <li>Consolidate your locations to streamline logistics</li>
          <li>Create a location that fits your needs, even if you're only renting</li>
          <li>Take a fresh look at your work environment</li>
          <li>Negociate for flexibility with regard to your space and sub-letting</li>

      content_html: |
        <p>
          Any business restructuring such as M&amp;As, outsourcing and
          strategic changes can lead to tremendous challenges and impact
          your company's real estate in the short and long term.
          Getting good advice at these crucial junctures is essential
          and may vary depending on your issue:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Group your locations together and streamline your real
            estate during mergers and acquisitions
          </li>
          <li>When restructuring your business, make your workspace more efficient</li>
          <li>Symbolize the renewal of your company image</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

          the change management process. In order to support your employees
          as best as possible, we analyse their needs, as well as
          their potential reluctances.

      header: Attract and Retain Talents
      content_html: |
        <p>
          A company's workspace is a unifying element in terms of image.
          Creating a good perception of your location for your current and
          future employees has an impact on your recruitment strategy:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a company showcase to attract talents</li>
          <li>Choose a location that matches your employees' needs and will help you maintain labour pool</li>
          <li>Ensure the peaceful coexistence of different generations within your company</li>
        </ul>
    developing_a_sustainability_strategy:
      header: Developing a Sustainability Strategy
      content_html: |
        <p>
          Sustainable development - a combination of economic development,
           social well being and environmental protection - can cause
           major challenges for businesses, the community and the individual.
        </p>
        <p>
          A project that focuses on sustainable development from the outset
          will provide an optimal return on investment throughout the
          lifecycle of the building, which is in your
          interest and that of the owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Monarch Eurasia helps you integrate environmental responsibility into
          your real estate project in various forms and at every step of
          the process: good choice of construction contractors and type of
          building to lease, work phases, moving logistics, training
          employees to adopt new behaviours, etc.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your building's envelope</li>
          <li>How you occupy your premises</li>
          <li>The everyday operation of your building</li>
          <li>Travel time of your employees</li>
        </ul>
